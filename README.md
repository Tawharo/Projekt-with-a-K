# Should I Stay, OR Should I GO?

Group project: Anthony Osiol, Tawheed Haroon, Jerome Kapeller

This is a webpage that helps the user decide if they want to stay home and make dinner or go out to a local restaurant.

From the text box, the user can request what type of cuisine they are interested in. After clicking on the "Should I Stay...In?" button, a drop down of recipes will show up relating to that particular cuisine. If they click "Should I Go...Out?", a drop down of local restaurants will show up with name, address and rating.
This was executed with the use of two different APIs.

We had an opprotunity to use Slack, Zoom to communicate within the group and used GitHub for updating the project as we were developing it. Communication about setting up the html to accept the API data went smoothly. Overall working within the group was great. We made critical decisions together as a group and helped each other out. We produced a Google slide show for the presentation and all had a chance to explain our particular parts of the project.

Challenges came to us at the very beginning. We had a hard time finding APIs that had a simple interaction with Ajax. We settled on Spoonacular for the recepies and Zomato for the restaurant listing. The data we needed from Spoonacular required a promise chain. Zomato ended up being pretty straight forward. The html and css also was pretty straight forward.
